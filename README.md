If you get an error related to Privileges/intents go to [discord.dev](https://discord.dev) and enable all the intents for your application. 
(discord.dev -> applications -> choose your application -> bot -> scroll down a bit -> there should be 'Privileged Gateway Intents' -> enable all)

The bot is not sending any messages? Make sure your intents are enabled and the bot has permission to send messages in the channel you're using the bot in. (You also have to specify the channels where the generate command can be used in.)

You dont get a dm from the bot? Make sure your dms are open.

If you have any other errors make a issue about it or you can also message me in discord (you can find my discord on my profile.)
